# Omnet++ LoRaWAN Simulator

Simple LoRaWAN Simulator for Omnet++ based on official aloha example. 
This tool simply simulates single-channel (EU 868.1 MHz) gateway scenarios for LoRaWAN networks. 

The simulation has a low footprint and can be extended easily for simple IoT scenarios. 

The simulation tool depends on Omnet++ and has been tested on the latest 6.0.3 macOS ARM version. 

## How to run: 

Clone or download the repo and import it from Omnet++ as an existing project. An example omnet.ini file can be run to test the given scenario.
